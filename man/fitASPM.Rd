\usage{
fitASPM(
  initpar,
  minfun,
  infish,
  inglb,
  inprops,
  gradtol = 1e-04,
  stepmax = 0.1,
  steptol = 1e-08,
  hessian = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{initpar}{a vector of 2 or 3 numbers that are the initial parameter
values given to the estimate of logR0, and the estimate of the variation
around the CPUE data that the model is to be fitted to, and finally, the
catchability coefficient.}

\item{minfun}{the dynamics function outputning a -ve log-likelihood}

\item{infish}{the fish data.frame from readdata or built in dataset}

\item{inglb}{the glb data.frame from readdata or built in dataset}

\item{inprops}{the props data.frame from readdata or built in dataset}

\item{gradtol}{default = 1e-04 a positive scalar giving the tolerance at
which the scaled gradient is considered close enough to zero to
terminate the algorithm. The scaled gradient is a measure of the
relative change in f in each direction p\link{i} divided by the relative
change in p\link{i} (copied frm nlm help).}

\item{stepmax}{default = 0.1 a positive scalar which gives the maximum
allowable scaled step length. stepmax is used to prevent steps which
would cause the optimization function to overflow, to prevent the
algorithm from leaving the area of interest in parameter space, or to
detect divergence in the algorithm. stepmax would be chosen small enough
to prevent the first two of these occurrences, but should be larger than
any anticipated reasonable step. (copied frm nlm help).}

\item{steptol}{default = 1e-08 A positive scalar providing the minimum
allowable relative step length. (copied frm nlm help).}

\item{hessian}{should hessian be estimated at the optimum, default = FALSE}
}
\value{
a list containing the optimal output
}
\description{
fitASPM fits an age-structured production model that can have
up to three parameters, R0 the unfished recruitment level, se the
variation around the estimated CPUE, and avq the catchability
coefficient. The inverse Hessian, when using log-likelihoods, provides
access to the variance-covariance matrix, which in turn can be used
to generate standard errors on the model parameters. This is used when
using asypmtotic errors to caharacterize uncertainty. See section 6.5
in Haddon (2021).
