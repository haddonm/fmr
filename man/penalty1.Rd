\title{penalty1 adds an increasingly large penalty as a value approaches 1.0}
\usage{
penalty1(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the parameter value that potentially incurs a penalty}
}
\value{
a single value as a penalty to be added to a Log-Likelihood or SSQ
}
\description{
penalty1 allows for the option of adding a large penalty as
a parameter approaches 1.0 and moves to become larger than 1. For
example, when fitting a surplus production model sometimes the
optimal mathematical model fit can occur by implying catches greater
than available biomass, implying harvest rates > 1.0. By adding a
large penalty to such values and adding those to the likelihood
such strange outcomes can be avoided. This will accept a single
value or a vector.

\examples{
 x <- c(0.5,0.8,0.88,0.9,0.98,0.99,1.01)
 round(cbind(x,penalty1(x)),4)
