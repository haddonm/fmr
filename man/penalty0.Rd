\title{penalty0 enables the adding of a large penalty as one approaches 0.0}
\usage{
penalty0(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the parameter value that potentially incurs a penalty}
}
\value{
a single value as a penalty to be added to a Log-Likelihood or SSQ
}
\description{
penalty0 allows for the option of adding a large penalty as
a parameter approaches 0.0 . See negLL1 for example code that
contains such a parameter. For example, when
fitting an spm sometimes the optimal mathematical model fit can occur
by depressing the r value to 0 or even go negative. Input values
< 0.006 begin to generate large values as one goes smaller. The
examples below illustrate this.
